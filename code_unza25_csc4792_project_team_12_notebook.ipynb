        "Legal and legislative documents are essential for promoting civic education, transparency, and the rule\n",
        "of law. However, the volume and complexity of these documents make it difficult for the public,\n",
        "researchers, and policymakers to easily locate and interpret relevant information.\n",
        "The DataLab Research Group at The University of Zambia is investigating the application of data mining\n",
        "techniques to improve the accessibility and organization of such documents.\n",

        "Two major publicly accessible sources of legal and legislative information in Zambia are:\n",
        "*  National Assembly of Zambia – Provides legislative bills, acts, and parliamentary debates.\n",

        "* Zambia Legal Information Institute (ZambiaLII) – Provides court judgments, case summaries, and\n",
